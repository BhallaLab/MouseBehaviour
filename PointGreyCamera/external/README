To install Spinnaker on linux you will need to configure the library path.
There are two ways this can be done.  You can temporarily 1) set the library
path using the export command in your current term window or 2) set it permanently
in your ".bashrc" script.  The last step is to set up the Read/Write permissions
on the device.  This can be done using our spin-conf script to configure
the udev rules on your system as seen in step 3. If you don't already have the
necessary dependencies for ffmpeg and libusb, please follow the instructions
in step 4.

1) Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in term

command:
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<Path to unpacked spinnaker tarball>/lib

ex:
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/spinnaker_1_0_0_262_x86_64/lib

Or...


2) set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH every time a term is opened in the .bashrc file

a) Open ~/.bashrc file in text editor

b) at the bottom of the file add this line:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<Path to unpacked spinnaker tarball>/lib

	
3) Configure udev rules on your system

a) execute the spin-conf script bundled in the tarball and follow the instructions.  The
script will create a 40-pgr.rules file in /etc/udev/rules.d and also create a pgrimaging
group on your system.  You will be asked to add your user to the pgrimaging group.

command:
	sudo ./spin-conf

	
4) Install Dependencies

a) Install ffmpeg

command:
	sudo apt-get install libavcodec-ffmpeg56 libavformat-ffmpeg56 libswscale-ffmpeg3 libswresample-ffmpeg1 libavutil-ffmpeg54

b) Install libusb

command:

	sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0

On Linux systems, image size is restricted to 2MiB or less by default. To
increase this limit so that you can make use of your imaging hardware's full
capabilities, you will need to make a minor change to your system. Full
instructions on making this change can be found at
