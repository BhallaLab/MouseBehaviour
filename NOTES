1. Hook the arduino up to a usb port
2. Verify/Compile the code and upload to the arduino
3. Run the python code to send in the session details and start reading data
4. ONLY THEN, press SELECT on the Arduino's LCD to begin the session.
NOTE: Pressing SELECT is going to start the trial whether or not the session details or data have been read

GENERAL NOTE: All codes to be uploaded to the Arduino, cycle through "void loop()" at some refresh rate.
Basically calculations, assignments, etc. can be executed every cycle, if specified as such.

TRACE EYE-BLINK CONDITIONING:
>> Associate a tone with the eye-blink response.
>> The US is an air-puff to the eye.
>> 5 s Pre-tone, 350 ms CS+/-, 100 ms US/No-US, Post-stim (till 20s trial).
>> ITI (randomized between 20-30 s). // Will have to check if randomization
is the best option.

The following is the trainning logic for running behaviour with head-fixed
mice, using assorted solenoids and an eye-blink sensor.
The code reports the current state on LCD screen, pushes output through a
simple solenoid driver circuit and transfers data to a serial port.
